Bit is short for binary digit with either of the two digits 0 and 1 in the
binary number system. The bit is the smallest unit of storage in a binary
system. Binary refers to base 2 arithmetic using the digits 0 and 1. Thus
a bit is a binary digit (i.e. a digit in the binary number system). It is the
most basic unit of information in digital computing
The AND-operation performs a bit-by-bit logical AND of two bitstrings of
the same length.
The OR-operation performs a bit-by-bit logical OR of two bitstrings of the
same length.
The XOR-operation performs a bit-by-bit logical exclusive OR of two bitstrings of the same length.
The MOD-operation returns the remainder (modulus) from dividing two
integer numbers.
The NOT-operation performs a bit-by-bit complement of a bitstring.
SHL shifts the value of the bitstring to the left count bits. A negative count
causes the data to be shifted the opposite way.
SHR shifts the value of the bitstring to the right count bits. A negative
count causes the data to be shifted the opposite way
