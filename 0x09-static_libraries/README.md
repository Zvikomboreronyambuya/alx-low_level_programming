A static library, also known as a "archive library," is a collection of precompiled object files that have been packaged together into a single file. It is a type of library used in software development for code reuse and efficient distribution of code modules. Static libraries are commonly used in C, C++, and other programming languages that support static linking.

Here's how static libraries work:

Compilation: The source code for a software project is typically divided into multiple source files (.c or .cpp files). Each source file is independently compiled into an object file (.o or .obj) by the compiler. The object file contains the machine code representation of the functions and data defined in that source file.

Archiving: Once all the object files have been created, the ar (archiver) command is used to package them together into a single file called a static library. The archiver creates an archive file with a specific format (e.g., "Ar" format on Unix-like systems), which includes all the object files in a concatenated form.

Linking: During the linking phase of the software build process, when building an executable or another shared library, the linker is responsible for resolving symbols (functions or data) used in the code. If the linker encounters unresolved symbols, it searches for the required symbols in the static libraries specified in the build command. If a symbol is found in a static library, the corresponding object code is extracted from the library and linked into the final executable.
